Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.4.2])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/home/julia/github/TFM-SnakeMake/snakemake/.snakemake/conda/a966d1f83a5f680e71882dce809a88e1/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is data/	(absolute path is '/home/julia/github/TFM-SnakeMake/snakemake/data/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)
Mapping set to single-end mode (user defined). File names need to be separated by commas [,] or colons [:]! Supplied file names are: data/samples/bsseq_sample1_R1.fastq.gz

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/home/julia/github/TFM-SnakeMake/snakemake'):
data/samples/bsseq_sample1_R1.fastq.gz
Library is assumed to be strand-specific (directional), alignments to strands complementary to the original top or bottom strands will be ignored (i.e. not performed!)
Output will be written into the directory: /home/julia/github/TFM-SnakeMake/snakemake/bams/
Setting parallelization to single-threaded (default)
