Multicore support not enabled. Proceeding with single-core trimming.
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 3.5
single-core operation.
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 3.5). Setting -j 1
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to B_trimmed.fq.gz


  >>> Now performing quality (cutoff '-q 20') and adapter trimming in a single pass for the adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' from file data/samples/B.fastq.gz <<< 
This is cutadapt 3.5 with Python 3.9.7
Command line parameters: -j 1 -e 0.1 -q 20 -O 1 -a AGATCGGAAGAGC data/samples/B.fastq.gz
